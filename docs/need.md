Needed stuff for compiling Kthura libraries:

- Tricky's Units for C++
- JCR6 for C++

For compiling the SDL Driver (as Kthura is written to it to use any library for this)
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- TQSG


Please note that Kthura was developed to be merged into my main projects, through Visual Studio 2019. 
That is why no .lib file or .dll files exist (at least not for the time being).
